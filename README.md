# Yet Another Machine Learning Guide

`Note: This is still in development and subject to change`

This guide focuses on practical use of Neural Networks (NNs) (a sub-topic of machine learning). The following topics will be covered:

## 1. Fudementals
### 1.1 A 10,000 Foot View of Regression
* What is Linear regression?
* What are the trainable parameters?
* Why is this useful?
### 1.2 Regression as an Optimization Problem
* What is optimization (in the context of CS)?
* How can we formulate regressions as an optimization problem?
* Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) overview.

## 2. Neural Networks
### 2.1 What are Neural Networks?
* NNs are a computational graph designed to model an unknown high-dimensional non-linear function.
* They involve various operations with trainable parameters put together in **layers** which can be optimized.
* Simple 1-layer fully-connected example.
### 2.2 Mathematics of Neural Networks
* Auto-differentiation
* Gradient Calculation
* SGD as a training mechanism

## 3. Example: Tweet Author Classifier

## 4. Convolution as a Layer for NNs
### 4.1 Introduction to Convolution
* What is it?
* How does it work mathematically?
* Formulation as a mat-mul.
### 4.2 Uses
* What can we use it for? (Hint: Images)

## 5. Example: Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)

## 6. Example: Semantic Segmentation
