# Yet Another Machine Learning Guide

`Note: This is still in development and subject to change`

This guide focuses on practical use of Neural Networks (NNs) (a sub-topic of machine learning). The following topics will be covered:

## 1. Fundamentals
### 1.1 A 10,000 Foot View of Regression
* What is Linear regression?
* What are the trainable parameters?
* Why is this useful?
### 1.2 Regression as an Optimization Problem
* What is optimization (in the context of CS)?
* How can we formulate regressions as an optimization problem?
* Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) overview.
### 1.3 Mathematics of Computational Graphs
* Gradient Calculation
* SGD as a training mechanism

## 2. Neural Networks
### Introduction to TensorFlow
* How to describe graphs
* How to perform simple math
### Neural Networks as Computational Graphs
* How a NN is represented as a computational graph
* How auto-differentiation works


## 3. Example: Tweet Author Classifier

## 4. Convolution as a Layer for NNs
### 4.1 Introduction to Convolution
* What is it?
* How does it work mathematically?
* Formulation as a mat-mul.
### 4.2 Uses
* What can we use it for? (Hint: Images)

## 5. Example: Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)

## 6. Example: Semantic Segmentation
